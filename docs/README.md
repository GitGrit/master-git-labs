Welcome to the Master Git in a Day labs!  Please work through the labs at the end of each corresponding part.

**Don't rush!**  If you get done with a section early, reinforce the concepts with more experimentation, or take a short break.  Check with your neighbors to see if you can help them out.

**Don't freak out!**  Everyone goes at their own pace, and it's ok if you don't finish a section before the next one begins.  If you're stuck, read the error message carefully and Google it (hey, that's how I learned!).  If the solution isn't straightforward, I'll help you through it!
