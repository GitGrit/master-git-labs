# Branches & Conflicts
Within a repository, multiple branches can exist.  Branches are like parallel universes of the same code base.  Typically one or two developers works on a specific task or feature on a branch.  When two people modify the same line of code in different ways, Git doesn't know what to do - you have to tell it.  This is a conflict, and you have to play the role of code traffic cop to decide what code can move forward.  This process is called conflict resolution.

1. In the terminal, navigate to the cloned repository
1. Create a new branch called cool-stuff, and check it out: `git checkout -b cool-stuff`
1. Look at the history with `git log`
1. Now make it more visual with `git log --graph`
1. Now make it less verbose with `git log --graph --oneline`
1. Change file1.txt again, then add, commit, and push it.
1. Make another branch (from the cool-stuff branch) with `git checkout -b rad`.  The rad branch's parent is cool-stuff, and the cool-stuff branch's parent is master.
1. View history thus far: `git log --graph --oneline`
1. Change file1.txt again, then add, commit, and push it.
1. In your cloned repository in GitHub, make a PR for the rad branch to go (merge) into the cool-stuff branch. Both of these branches are within your own repository.
1. Now change the PR so that rad goes into master *of your partner's* upstream repository.  You'll need to use the "compare across forks" option.
1. Back in your local repo (on the rad branch), change file1.txt again, then add, commit, and push it.
1. Notice that the PR (which is backed by the rad branch) has been updated
1. Partners: In your local version of this repository (which your partner later cloned), move to the master branch with `git checkout master`.
1. Ensure you have the latest code with `git pull origin master`
1. Make a change to file1.txt, then add, commit, and push it.
1. Your partner's PR may be in conflict now that you have both changed the same file.
1. Partners: from the rad branch, git `git pull upstream master`
1. Resolve conflicts in Atom.
1. Mark the conflicts as resolved using `git add`.  Then `git commit` and `git push` as usual.
1. Notice that the PR can safely be merged again
1. Partners: Approve and merge the PR
1. Give your partner write access to the master branch. In GitHub, this can be found in the repository settings under Collaborators.
1. Partners: push a change directly to master
1. Now try to push a similar change to master.  It should be rejected because your local master branch is no longer up to date.  Use `git pull origin master` to update it.

You can Google lots of different ways to format and prettify your logs.

{% hint style='tip' %}
Do you see the typical flow of tracking changes?  We always `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='tip' %}
On small projects with one or two people, pushing to master directly is normal.  In the professional world, this is rarely done, because everyone **must** use pull requests.
