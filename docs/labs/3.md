# Staging, Tracking, &amp; Fixing local commits
A repository doesn't know which files to care or not care about - you have to tell it.  The process of adding new files to be tracked or recording changes to existing files is called staging.  When you `commit`, you are recording the changes in your local repository only.  If you get this far and realize you've made a mistake, it's easy to fix because it still only lives on your machine.

Use `git status` throughout these steps to gain visibility into what's going on.

### Getting comfortable with staging

{% hint style='tip' %}
repo means repository
{% endhint %}

1. In the terminal, navigate back to the first repository you created in the *beginning* of part 1.
1. Make some changes to file1.txt, `git add file1.txt` to stage it.
1. Make more changes to the same file, use `git status` to see how some changes are staged and some are not
1. `git commit -m "I changed file1"` the first set of changes
1. `git add file1.txt` and `git commit -m "More changes to file1"` to stage and commit the second set of changes
1. Make yet another set of changes to this file.  Use `git add file1.txt` and `git reset HEAD file1.txt` to stage and then unstage the second set of changes.  Remember to use `git status` often to see what's happening!
1. Now that the changes are unstaged, `git checkout -- .` to undo them completely
1. Create a new file called `file3.txt`, notice again that `git status` tells you it's untracked.
1. `git add file3.txt` and `git commit -m "Added file3.txt"` to have Git track it
1. Undo the last commit so that the changes are reversed and staged: `git reset HEAD~1 --soft`.  Verify with `git status`.
1. Commit it again with `git commit -m "Merp"`
1. Redo the last commit with a different commit message using `git commit --amend -m "file3.txt... ah much better"`
1. Undo the last commit so that the changes are reversed and **not** staged: `git reset HEAD~`.  Verify with `git status`.
1. Add the file to the staging area again with `git add .`.  Commit it with `git commit -m "I added file3 for real this time"`
1. Undo the last commit so that the changes are completely discarded: `git reset HEAD~ --hard`.  Verify with `git status` **and** `ls -al`.  See that file3 is no longer there at all.  Great Scott, you just time-traveled!

### Ignoring files from the git repository

1. From your repo root (the same repo you used above), create these four .log files at the following paths:
  1. test.log
  1. .log
  1. bin/stuff/debug.log
  1. bin/.log
1. Use `git status` to see 3 red items (the contents of folders at this level - i.e. bin - are not displayed)
1. Run `git add .`, and then run `git status` to see 4 green items (now the contents are displayed)
1. Use `git reset HEAD .` to unstage all of them.  Verify with `git status`
1. Create a file called `.gitignore` in the root of the repository.  Let's make it exclude .log files.  Experiment with the [glob patterns](http://bit.ly/MasterGitGlob) below.  Meaning, put each pattern into the `.gitignore` file and save it, then run `git status` to see how Git "sees" (or doesn't) the file(s) to be tracked/staged.  Because some folders and files are nested, you may have to stage and unstage them to see the effect.
  1. .log (this catches 2/4 files)
  1. \*.log (this catches no files)
  1. bin/\*.log (How many does this catch and why?)
  1. bin/Stuff/\*.log (note case, Windows is case insensitive, Mac is not)
  1. bin/\*\*/\*.log (How many does this catch and why?)
1. Remove all of these files to get ready for the next part.  We call this "making your working directory clean".  But if you're in Atlanta, you get to say "so fresh and so clean clean".
