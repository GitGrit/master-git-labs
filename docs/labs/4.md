# Fixing really bad mistakes (bad commits after pushing)
Well, now you've done it.  You pushed some bad code to an otherwise good branch.  Or maybe you pushed some good code to the *wrong* branch.  Or maybe your code is good, but you just weren't finished with it yet, or it contained sensitive data, and you never really meant for other humans to see it.  Now some humans can see and get your code, and things are going to get awkward.

This happens to professionals, more often than most will admit.  Depending on the kind of mistake you made, your strategy for fixing it will vary.

### Commit good code to the wrong branch
1. Create a new branch from master called good
1. `add`, `commit`, and `push` a new file to this branch
1. Move back to the master branch using `checkout`
{% hint style='tip' %}
Remember that creating a branch will do so from whichever branch you happen to be on *when you do it*.  It's a good habit to always move back to your "base branch" (such as master) before creating a new branch, so you don't implicitly diverge from the wrong branch.
{% endhint %}
1. Create another new branch from master called bad
1. Make a change to a file, then `add`, `commit`, and `push` it
1. Have your partner `fetch` the changes to the repository.  Notice that they can now see this commit on the bad branch.
1. But... oops!  We meant to push this change to the good branch, not the bad branch!  Use `cherry-pick` to copy the commit from bad branch to the branch-1 branch.
1. Remember that - just like all git operations - this is done locally.  `push` the change so your partner can see this commit, now on the good branch.
1. But the commit still exists on the bad branch.  Now what?
{% hint style='tip' %}
Cherry-picking doesn't move a commit, it copies it.  You still have to remove the old commit from the bad branch.
{% endhint %}

### Undo the commit with revert
1. On the bad branch, `revert` the commit that shouldn't have have been made.
1. Using `log` you can see that a new commit exists which effectively undoes whatever was done in the bad commit
1. Remember that local changes must be `push`ed to the remote repository!  Do that now!
1. Have your partner verify that they can see the "undo" (revert) commit

### The nuclear option: reset and force push

Reset should look familiar to you - we used it in part 2 for staging.  Reset tells Git to move the HEAD ref to the specific commit you provide.  `reset` it different from `checkout` because it assumes you want to get rid of changes that have happened after that point.  (Whereas `checkout` will give you a detached HEAD state, indicating that you've gone back in time but only in a temporary, read-only way.)

Because `reset` is destructive, you can't simply `push` this to the remote repository.  You must **force** `push` it.  Force pushing changes (or, rewrites) history for whoever else might be using the same branch.  It's like pulling the bottom layer out from under their Jenga tower.  Their code foundation is gone or drastically different, and major problems will ensue.  Because of this, **force pushing is NEVER ok to do when other people are using the branch!**  

1. We want to *forcibly* go back to the commit before any of this ever happened.  Find that commit and `reset` to it.
2. Force push this change using `push -f`
3. Have your partner verify that they can no longer see the bad commit nor the commit that undid it.  It's like... it's been erased.
