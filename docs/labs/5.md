# Team Workflows & Release Management
So far, we've learned and used concepts that are sufficient for collaborating with one or two people on a hobby project.  In the professional world, the code bases and the teams are bigger.  That code is tested, versioned, released to end users, and then supported and maintained.  Workflows refer to the guidelines teams adhere to, by convention, to keep work organized.  The way code is merged into the main branch (master) can also vary, but should be standardized amongst all team members.

### Tagging
1. You should now have quite a few commits to work with in your master branch.  If you need more, make some now.
1. Choose a commit a few revisions back and `tag` it (lightweight) as "0.0.1"
1. Choose a commit after that point and `tag` it (annotated) as "1.0.0"
1. Remember that changes must always be pushed to the remote repository.  Do that now.
1. Have your partner `fetch` latest changes and they should see the two tags you created.

### Gitflow
1. From the master branch, create a new branch called develop
1. From the develop branch, create a new branch called feature-123
1. Make 2 or more commits on this branch and push them to the remote repository.
1. Make a pull request for feature-123 to be merged into develop
1. Have your partner approve it.
1. After it's approved, use GitHub's dropdown on the green Merge button to specify that you would like a merge commit.  Then click the Merge button.
1. Both of you should move back to the develop branch and `pull` the latest code that was just merged.

### Squashing
1. Repeat steps 2 - 5 of the Gitflow steps above (this time call the branch something else)
1. On step 6, use GitHub's dropdown on the green Merge button to specify that you would like to *squash* the commits when merging.  Then click the Merge button.
1. Repeat step 7, but notice that the history is more concise: multiple commits from the PR have been *squashed* into one.

### Rebasing
1. Repeat steps 2 - 5 of the Gitflow steps above (this time call the branch something else)
1. On step 6, use GitHub's dropdown on the green Merge button to specify that you would like to *rebase* the commits, then merge.  Then click the Merge button.
1. Repeat step 7, but notice that the history is different.  A merge commit is not present.
