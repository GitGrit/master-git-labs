# Working with repositories and remotes (pushing &amp; pulling)
In Git, repositories are special directories that track their own content.  Remotes are connections between repositories.  Pushing means sending code outward, to a remote repository.  Pulling means taking code inward, from a remote repository.

Before you begin the labs, decide who is "UserA" and who is "UserB".  You should **each** have a laptop.  **Both** of you should follow the steps below, respectively, on your machines.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='tip' %}
Navigate to your <yourUserDirectory>/MasterGitInADay folder before you begin!
{% endhint %}

1. Ensure you are in your repository home directory by running `pwd`.  If you aren't in the right place, navigate there using `cd <yourUserDirectory>/MasterGitInADay`
1. Create a folder here for a new repository called "UserARepo1": `mkdir UserA_Repo1` (If you are UserB, change the directory name to `UserB_Repo1`)
1. Navigate into this folder using `cd UserA_Repo1`  (If you are UserB, change the directory name to `UserB_Repo1`)  Pro tip: If you type `cd Us` and then hit tab, it should autocomplete for you.  This works for all terminal commands!
1. Use `git init` to turn this folder into a local git repository
1. Ensure you can see the .git folder.  In the terminal, you can list all files (including hidden ones starting with a period) using `ls -al`.  Note that, on some operating systems, you may need to configure your file *explorer* to show these files & folders because they are hidden.
1. Use `git status` to check out what's going on.  You should see "no commits yet".  Notice that you're on the master branch.
1. Create an empty file called file1.txt: `touch file1.txt`
1. In Atom, go to "File" -> "Add Project Folder..." and open the `<yourUserDirectory>/MasterGitInADay` folder as a project.
1. Open file1.txt and put something in it.
1. Use `ls -al` again to see that the file now exists.  Note that on some operating systems, you may need to configure your file explorer to show file *extensions* so you see "file1.txt" instead of "file1".
1. Use `git status` to see that this file is untracked, in red.  Pro tip: You can hit the up arrow to go back in your command history, which also saves you typing and time!
1. Use `git add file1.txt`, which stages it.
1. Run `git status` again to see that the file is staged (listed under the "Changes to be committed" section, in green)
1. Run `git commit -m "Initial commit"` to make a commit with that message.  Pro tip: You can commit with simply `git commit`, but it will open the configured editor (usually vim) for you to write a commit message there.  Google "vim cheatsheet" in case you get trapped in Vim Land!
1. Run `git remote -v` to list your remotes.  Notice that there are none.
1. In GitHub, login using your username.  Create a new public repository with the same name: `UserA_Repo1` (or `UserB_Repo1`).
1. After creating it, GitHub will give you command-line instructions for connecting your local *existing* repository with this one you just created in the cloud.  Run that command locally.
1. Run `git remote -v` again to verify that the remote is set up correctly.  You should see `origin	https://github.com/yourGitHubUsername/UserAorB_Repo1.git` twice - once for fetching and once for pushing.
1. Attempt to push to the origin remote using `git push`.  Notice the message you get about no upstream branch.
1. Because the previous command was a little vague (intentionally, because we want to type less), we need to ensure git will always *assume* that we mean "push to `origin master`" when we're on this local master branch.  Run `git push -u origin master` to do this.  Pro tip: The `-u` is a shorthand for `--set-upstream`.
1. Have your partner fork your repository by visiting your repository's URL and clicking the "Fork" button in the upper right-hand corner.
1. After forking each other's repositories, notice that there is a green clone button in the upper right in the forked repository on GitHub.  This will give you the command to clone the forked repository locally (in the next step).  Double check the URL to ensure you're about to clone the correct repository!
1. Locally, move to the folder in which the repository will be cloned to: `cd <yourUserDirectory>/MasterGitInADay`.  Now run the clone command from the previous step.
1. In the newly cloned repository, add the upstream repository with `git remote add upstream <GitURLOfTheOriginalRepo>`
1. In this repository, you should now have two remote URLs (origin and upstream, each with fetch & push).  Check this with `git remote -v`.
1. In Atom, open up the **cloned repository** (which your partner originally created).  Make some change to file1.txt.
1. Stage these changes with `git add file1.txt` and then commit it with `git commit -m "I made a change to your file!"`
1. `git push` it to your *origin* remote with `git push origin master`
1. Try to `git push` it to the upstream with git push upstream master
1. In GitHub, make a pull request to your partnerâ€™s repository.  You can do this by going to the URL of the cloned repository (it will be your partner's repository, but under your username).  Click the "Create pull request" button, then choose "compare across forks".  Your cloned repository's master branch should be going *into* your partner's master branch.
1. In your partner's repository, the pull request will appear under the "pull requests" tab.  Have your partner approve the pull request.
1. After your partner approves the pull request, refresh the pull request URL to see the approval.  Now merge it with the merge button.
1. Make your local repository aware of these changes with `git fetch`
1. And now `git pull upstream master` to actually update the HEAD ref of the master branch.
