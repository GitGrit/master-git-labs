# Working with repositories and remotes (pushing &amp; pulling)
In Git, repositories are special directories that track their own content.  As the files and the contents within them change over time, Git remembers versions of this history using commits.  Each commit has a 40-character SHA hash associated with it so it can be uniquely identified.

Navigate to your _yourUserDirectory_/MasterGitInADay folder before you begin!

### Init a repository and add a file

1. Ensure you are in your _repository_ home directory by running `pwd`.  If you aren't in the right place, navigate there using `cd <yourUserDirectory>/MasterGitInADay`
1. Create a folder here for a new repository called "YourName_Repo1": `mkdir YourName_Repo1`
1. Navigate into this folder using `cd YourName_Repo1` Pro tip: If you type `cd `, then the first few letters, and then hit tab, it should autocomplete for you.  This works for all terminal commands!
1. Use `git init` to turn this folder into a local git repository
1. Ensure you can see the .git folder.  In the terminal, you can list all files (including hidden ones starting with a period) using `ls -al`.  Note that, on some operating systems, you may need to configure your file *explorer* to show these files & folders because they are hidden.
1. Use `git status` to check out what's going on.  You should see "no commits yet".  Notice that you're on the master branch.
1. Create an empty file called file1.txt: `touch file1.txt`
1. In Atom, go to "File" -> "Add Project Folder..." and open the `<yourUserDirectory>/MasterGitInADay` folder as a project.
1. Open file1.txt and put something in it.  Save the changes.
1. Back in the terminal, use `ls -al` again to see that the file now exists.  Note that on some operating systems, you may need to configure your file explorer to show file *extensions* so you see "file1.txt" instead of "file1".
1. Use `git status` to see that this file is untracked, in red.  Pro tip: You can hit the up arrow to go back in your command history, which also saves you typing and time!
1. Use `git add file1.txt`, which stages it.
1. Run `git status` again to see that the file is staged (listed under the "Changes to be committed" section, in green)
1. Run `git commit -m "Initial commit"` to make a commit with that message.  Note the commit hash that is produced (just the first 4-some characters).  Pro tip: You can commit with simply `git commit`, but it will open the configured editor (or if none is configured, vim) for you to write a commit message there.  Google "vim cheatsheet" in case you get trapped in Vim Land!


### Clone a repository

1. Move out of the repository you're currently in (the one you created in the steps above).  Do this by typing `cd ../`
1. Now, rather than creating a repository on your machine from scratch, you're going to clone one from GitHub.  Clone [this repository](https://github.com/lyndseypadget/LPadget_Repo1) using the URL provided by GitHub's green "clone or download" button.  (You may have to use a HTTPS or SSH depending on the way you configured Git.)  The command will look like `git clone <URL>`.
1. Type  `ls -al` to see that the repository was cloned successfully into a folder with the name LPadget_Repo1.
1. Move into this folder with `cd LPadget_Repo1`.  Look around with `pwd` and `ls -al`.  Open it up in atom with `atom .` if you want to explore the files.
1. Back on the command line, move back up a directory again with `cd ../`.
1. Repeat the clone command (hint: hit the up arrow in your terminal a few times until you find it) except **this time** provide one more argument.  After that same clone command, add a space and a name of your choosing.  So your command should look like `git clone <url> <name>`.
1. After the command completes, type `ls -al`.  Notice that there is a folder with the name you provided in the last step.
1. Once again, move into the directory with the `cd` command.  It's the same repo contents - the only thing that has changed is the name of the folder it's in.  Neat!
