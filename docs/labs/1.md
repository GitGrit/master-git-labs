# Working with repositories and remotes (pushing &amp; pulling)
In Git, repositories are special directories that track their own content.  Remotes are connections between repositories.  Pushing means sending code outward, to a remote repository.  Pulling means taking code inward, from a remote repository.

1. `init` an empty project locally
1. Look at the .git folder
1. Use `status` to check out what's going on
1. Notice you’re on the master branch
1. Make a file, `add` (stage) and `commit` it
1. Make a repository in GitHub
1. Set up the origin `remote`
1. `push` to the remote
1. Have your partner `fork` your repository
1. Have your partner `clone` their forked repository
1. Have your partner set up your repository as the upstream `remote`
1. In the repository you cloned, make a change, `add` and commit it
1. `push` it to your remote with git push origin master
1. Try to `push` it to the upstream with git push upstream master
1. Make a pull request to your partner’s repository
1. After your partner approves it, `merge` it
1. Make your local repository aware of these changes with `fetch`
1. Type `git status` to see that you’re behind
1. And now `pull` from the origin's master branch to actually update the HEAD reference
