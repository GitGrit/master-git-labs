# Working with repositories and remotes (pushing &amp; pulling)
In Git, remotes are connections between repositories.  Pushing means sending code outward, to a remote repository.  Pulling means taking code inward, from a remote repository.

When modifying the contents of files (we use txt files for simplicity), it's best to add a new line in the file for each change.
{% endhint %}

1. Ensure you are in the directory (using `pwd`) of the repository you init'ed in the beginning of Part 1. If you aren't in the right place, navigate there using `cd <yourUserDirectory>/MasterGitInADay/YourName_Repo1`.  Type `ls -al` for good measure; you should see _your_ file1.txt.
1. Run `git remote -v` to list your remotes.  Notice that there are none.
1. In GitHub, login using your username.  Create a new public repository with the same name: `YourName_Repo1`.
1. After creating it, GitHub will give you command-line instructions for connecting your local *existing* repository with this one you just created in the cloud.  It's under "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line".  Run those two commands locally.  This will push the commit you made earlier into the remote repository.
1. Run `git remote -v` again to see that the remote (called "origin") is set up.  You should see `origin https://github.com/yourGitHubUsername/YourName_Repo1.git` twice - once for fetching and once for pushing.
1. Attempt to push to the origin remote using `git push origin master`.  You should be able to tell that it worked because it will say `Writing objects: 100%` and give you a new commit hash.
1. Refresh your repository in GitHub to see that the file you added is there.  You'll see "1 commit", which is the same commit (and same commit hash!) as the commit you made locally.  The time reflects the time the commit was made, not when it was pushed.

### Now we're going to **delete your local Git repository**.

Imagine that this directory is full of code, and you're about to blow it away!  Come on... It's like a Git trust fall.  It's going to be fun.

1. In the terminal, we'll assume you're still in your `<yourUserDirectory>/MasterGitInADay/YourName_Repo1` folder.  Move up a directory with `cd ../`.
1. Remove the directory with the force and recursive options.  **This command is powerful and dangerous.  Measure twice, cut once!** `rm -rf YourName_Repo1`
1. Back in GitHub, find the clone URL for your repository.  This is the green "Clone or download" button in the upper right of the repository.  Copy this URL (HTTPS is easier, but SSH is safer).
1. Now we're going to get the repository back on your local machine by using the clone command in the terminal: `git clone <the_clone_url>`
1. Type `ls -al` to confirm that the repository is there again!  Congratulations, you just brought sexy back!
1. Don't forget to move back into the repository directory with `cd YourName_Repo1`.
1. In the newly cloned repository, run `git remote -v` to see that the origin remote was automatically set up for us.  How convenient!
1. In Atom, open up this repository again (if needed).  Make some change to `file1.txt`.  Add another (empty) file called `file2.txt`.
1. Type `git status` to see that one file is modified and one file is untracked.
1. Stage both of these changes with `git add .` and inspect again with `git status`.
1. Commit it with `git commit -m "I changed a file and added another"`
1. `git push` it to your *origin* remote with `git push origin master`.  (Pro tip: `git push` would also work, but I think being explicit here is a helpful habit.)
1. In GitHub, notice that you now have two commits and (coincidentally) two files.
1. Still in GitHub, click on `file2.txt` and see that it's empty.  Click the pencil icon to edit the contents of the file.
1. Add a sentence to this file using the GitHub editor.
1. At the bottom, enter "I added a sentence" in the commit description.  (An extended description is not needed... unless you just need typing practice.)
1. Leave the default radio button selected (use master branch) and click the green button to commit.
1. Back in the terminal, pull these changes using `git pull origin master`
1. Now open file2.txt in Atom and see your awesome sentence!  Pat yourself on the back - you just pushed and pulled your way to the end of this section!
