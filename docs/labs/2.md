# Staging, Tracking, &amp; Fixing local commits
A repository doesn't know which files to care or not care about - you have to tell it.  The process of adding new files to be tracked or recording changes to existing files is called staging.  When you `commit`, you are recording the changes in your local repository only.  If you get this far and realize you've made a mistake, it's easy to fix because it still only lives on your machine.

Use `git status` throughout these steps to gain visibility into what's going on.

### Getting comfortable with staging

{% hint style='tip' %}
repo means repository
{% endhint %}

1. In the terminal, navigate back to the first repository you created in the beginning of part 1.
1. Make some changes to file1.txt, `git add file1.txt` to stage it.
1. Make more changes to the same file, use `git status` to see how some changes are staged and some are not
1. `git commit -m "I changed file1.txt again"` the first set of changes
1. `git add file1.txt` and `git commit -m "More changes"` to stage and commit the second set of changes
1. Make more changes to this file, use `git add file1.txt` and `git reset HEAD file1.txt` to stage and commit the second set of changes
1. Now that the changes are unstaged, `git checkout --` to undo them completely
1. Create a new file, notice what `git status` says now
1. `git add` and `cgit ommit` it to have git track it
1. `git push` all of these commits to the origin repo  
1. Make a bad `git commit`, but donâ€™t push
1. Undo the last commit (soft `git reset`)
1. `git commit` it again
1. Redo the last commit with a different commit message using `git commit --amend -m "some new message"`
1. Undo the last commit (hard `git reset`)
1. Make another change.  `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` it

### Ignoring files from the git repository

1. Create four log files in your repo:
  1. test.log
  1. .log
  1. /bin/stuff/debug.log
  1. /bin/.log
1. Use `git status` to see 3 red items
1. Use `git add` to see 4 green items
1. Use `git reset HEAD .` to unstage all of them
1. Add a .gitignore file which excludes .log files
1. Experiment with glob patterns:
  1. .log (this catches 2/4 files)
  1. \*.log (this catches no files)
  1. bin/\*.log (how many does this catch?)
  1. bin/Stuff/\*.log (note case, Windows is case insensitive, Mac is not)
  1. bin/\*\*/\*.log (how many does this catch?)

{% hint style='tip' %}
The `.` (period) means "all files"
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='tip' %}
You can Google glob patterns to learn more about this way of specifying filenames.
{% endhint %}
