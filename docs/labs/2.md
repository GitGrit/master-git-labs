# Working with repositories and remotes (pushing &amp; pulling)
In Git, repositories are special directories that track their own content.  Remotes are connections between repositories.  Pushing means sending code outward, to a remote repository.  Pulling means taking code inward, from a remote repository.

Navigate to your _yourUserDirectory_/MasterGitInADay folder before you begin!
{% endhint %}

1. Ensure you are in your repository home directory by running `pwd`.  If you aren't in the right place, navigate there using `cd <yourUserDirectory>/MasterGitInADay`
1. Create a folder here for a new repository called "YourName_Repo1": `mkdir YourName_Repo1`
1. Navigate into this folder using `cd YourName_Repo1` Pro tip: If you type `cd `, then the first few letters, and then hit tab, it should autocomplete for you.  This works for all terminal commands!
1. Use `git init` to turn this folder into a local git repository
1. Ensure you can see the .git folder.  In the terminal, you can list all files (including hidden ones starting with a period) using `ls -al`.  Note that, on some operating systems, you may need to configure your file *explorer* to show these files & folders because they are hidden.
1. Use `git status` to check out what's going on.  You should see "no commits yet".  Notice that you're on the master branch.
1. Create an empty file called file1.txt: `touch file1.txt`
1. In Atom, go to "File" -> "Add Project Folder..." and open the `<yourUserDirectory>/MasterGitInADay` folder as a project.
1. Open file1.txt and put something in it.  Save the changes.
1. Back in the terminal, use `ls -al` again to see that the file now exists.  Note that on some operating systems, you may need to configure your file explorer to show file *extensions* so you see "file1.txt" instead of "file1".
1. Use `git status` to see that this file is untracked, in red.  Pro tip: You can hit the up arrow to go back in your command history, which also saves you typing and time!
1. Use `git add file1.txt`, which stages it.
1. Run `git status` again to see that the file is staged (listed under the "Changes to be committed" section, in green)
1. Run `git commit -m "Initial commit"` to make a commit with that message.  Note the commit hash that is produced (just the first 4-some characters).  Pro tip: You can commit with simply `git commit`, but it will open the configured editor (or if none is configured, vim) for you to write a commit message there.  Google "vim cheatsheet" in case you get trapped in Vim Land!
1. Run `git remote -v` to list your remotes.  Notice that there are none.
1. In GitHub, login using your username.  Create a new public repository with the same name: `YourName_Repo1`.
1. After creating it, GitHub will give you command-line instructions for connecting your local *existing* repository with this one you just created in the cloud.  It's under "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line".  Run those two commands locally.  This will push the commit into the remote repository.
1. Run `git remote -v` again to see that the remote (called "origin") is set up.  You should see `origin https://github.com/yourGitHubUsername/YourName_Repo1.git` twice - once for fetching and once for pushing.
1. Attempt to push to the origin remote using `git push`.  Notice the message that says everything is up-to-date.
1. Refresh your repository in GitHub to see that the file you added is there.  You'll see "1 commit", which is the same commit (and same commit hash!) as the commit you made locally.  The time reflects the time the commit was made, not when it was pushed.

### Now we're going to **delete your local Git repository**.

Imagine that this directory is full of code, and you're about to blow it away!  Come on... It's like a Git trust fall.  It's going to be fun.

1. In the terminal, we'll assume you're still in your `<yourUserDirectory>/MasterGitInADay/YourName_Repo1` folder.  Move up a directory with `cd ../`.
1. Remove the directory with the force and recursive options.  **This command is powerful and dangerous.  Measure twice, cut once!** `rm -rf YourName_Repo1`
1. Back in GitHub, find the clone URL for your repository.  This is the green "Clone or download" button in the upper right of the repository.  Copy this URL (HTTPS is easier, but SSL is safer).
1. Now we're going to get the repository back on your local machine by using the clone command in the terminal: `git clone <the_clone_url>`
1. Type `ls -al` to confirm that the repository is there again!  Congratulations, you just brought sexy back!
1. Don't forget to move back into the repository directory with `cd YourName_Repo1`.
1. In the newly cloned repository, run `git remote -v` to see that the origin remote was automatically set up for us.  How convenient!
1. In Atom, open up this repository again (if needed).  Make some change to `file1.txt`.  Add another (empty) file called `file2.txt`.
1. Type `git status` to see that one file is modified and one file is untracked.
1. Stage both of these changes with `git add .` and inspect again with `git status`.
1. Commit it with `git commit -m "I changed a file and added another"`
1. `git push` it to your *origin* remote with `git push origin master`.  (Pro tip: `git push` would also work, but I think being explicit here is a helpful habit.)
1. In GitHub, notice that you now have two commits and (coincidentally) two files.
1. Still in GitHub, click on `file2.txt` and see that it's empty.  Click the pencil icon to edit the contents of the file.
1. Add a sentence to this file using the GitHub editor.
1. At the bottom, enter "I added a sentence" in the commit description.  (An extended description is not needed... unless you just need typing practice.)
1. Leave the default radio button selected (use master branch) and click the green button to commit.
1. Back in the terminal, pull these changes using `git pull origin master`
1. Now open file2.txt in Atom and see your awesome sentence!  Pat yourself on the back - you just pushed and pulled your way to the end of this section!
