# Staging, Tracking, &amp; Fixing local commits
A repository doesn't know which files to care or not care about - you have to tell it.  The process of adding new files to be tracked or recording changes to existing files is called staging.  When you `commit`, you are recording the changes in your local repository only.  If you get this far and realize you've made a mistake, it's easy to fix because it still only lives on your machine.

{% hint style='tip' %}
Use `git status` throughout these steps to gain visibility into what's going on.
{% endhint %}

### Getting comfortable with staging

1. Make some changes to a file, `add` the file to stage it
1. Make more changes to the same file, use `git status` how some changes are staged and some are not
1. `commit` the first set of changes
1. `add` and `commit` the second set of changes
1. Make more changes to this file, `add` and `reset` to stage and unstage
1. Now that the changes are unstaged, `checkout --` to undo them completely
1. Create a new file, notice what `git status` says now
1. `add` and `commit` it to have git track it
1. `push` all of these commits to the origin repo
  {% hint style='tip' %}
  repo means repository
  {% endhint %}
1. Make a bad `commit`, but donâ€™t push
1. Undo the last commit (soft `reset`)
1. `commit` it again
1. Redo the last commit with a different commit message using `git commit --amend -m "some new message"`
1. Undo the last commit (hard `reset`)
1. Make another change.  `add`, `commit`, and `push` it

### Ignoring files from the git repository

1. Create four log files in your repo:
  1. test.log
  1. .log
  1. /bin/stuff/debug.log
  1. /bin/.log
1. Use `status` to see 3 red items
1. Use `add` to see 4 green items
1. Use `reset HEAD .` to unstage all of them
  {% hint style='tip' %}
  The `.` (period) means "all files"
  {% endhint %}
1. Add a .gitignore file which excludes .log files
1. Experiment with glob patterns:
  1. .log (this catches 2/4 files)
  1. \*.log (this catches no files)
  1. bin/\*.log (how many does this catch?)
  1. bin/Stuff/\*.log (note case, Windows is case insensitive, Mac is not)
  1. bin/\*\*/\*.log (how many does this catch?)
    {% hint style='tip' %}
    You can Google glob patterns to learn more about this way of specifying filenames.
    {% endhint %}
